The formatDistanceToNow function in the date-fns package is used to return the gap between the given date and now in words.

import {formatDistanceToNow} from 'date-fns'

console.log(formatDistanceToNow(new Date())); // less than a minute

The following instructions are required for the tests to pass

HTML input element for name should have the placeholder as Your Name
HTML textarea element for comment should have the placeholder as Your Comment

Things to Keep in Mind

All components you implement should go in the src/components directory.

Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.

Do not remove the pre-filled code
